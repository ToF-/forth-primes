# Finding more primes

If we know primes in the range *2* to *p*, then we can find all composites from *p* to *p²* as shown in the `sieve.fs` program, where *p* = 251.


suppose we know only 2,3,5,7, then if n=6, we can have a sieve from 10 to 59, where numbers 10,12,14,16,18,…,58,15,21,27,33,39,45,51,57,25,35,55,49 are marked as composite leaving 11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53 as primes.
